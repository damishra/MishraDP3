#Server Programming Project 3

##Goal
Your job is to write a RESTful service in Node.js for a company to allow them to track timecards for employees. You are required to use the provided Data Layer (see separate documentation – same as for Projects 2). There is a separate zip file for the Data Layer (see below on how to include in your app). You need to create the Service as per below, including any validation mentioned which should be in your Business Layer. You can put other things in your Business Layer if you wish. You need to use your RIT user ID for the company name whenever it is asked for. For error output, return an appropriate error message (not the String “An appropriate error message.”)
